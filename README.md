# pure-vegi-app

This is vegetable marketing app which we designed for our web technologies group project. We created this app using HTML, CSS, Angular, NodeJs, ExpressJs and MySQL database.

This will be a great platform for buyers who are finding vegetables and vegetable sellers who are seeking custormers to sell their items. Both of them will get a great advantage through this. They can contact each other and continue their preferences without wasting their valuable time. 

First year undergraduates from University of Moratuwa ; Shihara Jayasinghe, Akila Sachintha, Sachin Viraj, Ishini Dilthara and Tharukshi Gunasekara have contributed for this project.
